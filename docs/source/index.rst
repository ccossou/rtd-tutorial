Welcome to Miritools's documentation!
===================================

The **miritools** package contains convenience functions usefull to display or characterize MIRI data on board JWST. Some are more generic and could be usefull in general, but all of them have been created with MIRI in mind in some way or another.

Miritools start at v4.0.0. This is for historical reasons because it is based on the miricap package and I kept the version number for convenience.

Each section is a sub-package. Check :ref:`installation` the project.
